# 🐳 Web Server Containerization with Docker
---
### CodeAlpha DevOps Internship - Task 2

---

## 📝 Project Overview

This project focuses on the core DevOps practice of containerization. I have successfully packaged a responsive Restaurant Website into a lightweight Docker container using Nginx. To demonstrate real-world deployment, the local container is exposed to the global internet via a secure Ngrok tunnel.

### What this project contains:

**Dockerfile:** The blueprint for building our custom web server image.

**Web Content:** A custom-coded HTML/CSS Restaurant landing page.

**Container Logic:** Port mapping (8080:80) to bridge the host machine and the container.

**Global Tunnel:** Integration with Ngrok for cross-device access (Mobile/Tablet).

## 🏗️ Architecture & Workflow

The workflow follows a standard DevOps "Build-Ship-Run" pipeline:

* **Code:** Developer creates the web files and the Dockerfile.

* **Build:** Docker Engine reads the Dockerfile to create an Image.

* **Run:** Docker creates a Container from that image.

* **Expose:** The internal Nginx server (Port 80) is mapped to the Local Host (Port 8080).

* **Tunnel:** Ngrok generates a public URL to allow external traffic to reach the local container.

🚀 Local Deployment (In Short)
To get this project running on your machine:

Clone the Repo:

Bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CodeAlpha_Web_Server_using_Docker.git
cd CodeAlpha_Web_Server_using_Docker
Build the Image:

Bash
docker build -t restaurant-server .
Run the Container:

Bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 --name codealpha-task4 restaurant-server
Access: Visit http://localhost:8080

🎓 What I Learned from CodeAlpha
Through this task at CodeAlpha, I gained hands-on experience in:

Dockerization: How to convert static code into a portable, scalable image.

Image Optimization: Using nginx:alpine to keep the deployment size small and secure.

Networking: Understanding port forwarding and managing traffic between the host and the container.

Troubleshooting: Managing WSL 2 and Docker Engine synchronization.

🚩 Internship Milestones
✅ Repository Naming: CodeAlpha_Web_Server_using_Docker

✅ Containerization: Custom Nginx-Alpine image built and optimized for production.

✅ Global Access: Integrated Ngrok tunnel to bypass NAT and expose local containers to the internet.

✅ DevOps Workflow: Fully implemented the Build → Ship → Run lifecycle.
